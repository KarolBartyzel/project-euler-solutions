*Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:*

*1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...*

*By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.*

We could have used recurrency, but let's go straight to fast solution. Assumptions:
* fib(n) = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)
* When we have result of fib(n) we can save it to array and use it calculating fib(n+k).
* Moreover, we can cut memory usage. We don't need all previous results. All we need to solve this task is 2 variables to remember fib(n-1) and fib(n-2).

Lets introduce 3 variables a, b and c. Initialize a with 1, b with 2 and c with 2.
* To calculate fib(3) we need to calculate sum of a and b `c = a + b;`
* Now to not loose fib(2) we need to assign b value to a.
* Finally assign c to b.

Before: a = 1, b = 2, c = 2;

After: a = 2, b = 3, c = 3;

In variable b we have next term of fibonacci sequence. Easy, right ?
